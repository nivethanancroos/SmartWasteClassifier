Smart Waste Classification
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the EC9570 â€“ Digital Image Processing course at the Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Jaffna.
The aim of this work is to build a Smart Waste Management System using image classification techniques. The system automatically classifies waste images into different categories (e.g., recyclable, organic, plastic, etc.) using deep learning models.

By automating waste classification, this project contributes towards sustainable waste management and supports environmental conservation efforts.


ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

To analyze and preprocess a dataset of waste images.

To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification.

To evaluate the trained modelâ€™s performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

To provide a simple and practical solution for waste categorization without using hardware.
